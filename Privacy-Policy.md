BitBot (Accesible using our bot BitBot) won't store personal data from users. We only store the count of virtual coins that the user has mined (Because the bot is a BitcoinBot). We also store the UserID in order to make sure everyone gets the right
amount of coins to their account. Stealing data is not possible, since you can only use your own data and manage it.
