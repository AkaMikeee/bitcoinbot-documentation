# BitcoinBot Documentation
Documentation for the bitcoinbot on discord. You can mostly find errors in this documentation.

# 1. Selling system:
Why is there a limit of 4b?
Due to some weird issues the code starts doing "weird" things when it is over the 4b. We are working on fixing this

# 2. Open Source?
Because I (Mike) have spent a lot of time on developing this code for this bot, there will not be an opensource. People will probably start stealing my code and claiming that it's their bot.

# 3. Why is the bot slow?
This is because it needs to update a json file whenever something happens. Because the bot is sharded 4 times, it needs to quickly restart all the shards, and this can take some time. We are currently working developing something more efficient.
